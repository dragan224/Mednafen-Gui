## Mednafen Library Manager

Simple library manager for mednafen psx games (bin / cue format).


### How to run
1) Place this .exe in the same folder as mednafen
2) Place all your games in the 'games' folder in the same folder as mednafen. You can structure games however you want inside the folder. 
3) Run the exe

Folder structure:
```
mednafen.exe
gui.exe
games/.../my_game_1.cue
games/.../.../my_game_2.cue

For linux you might need to compile things yourself. Extensions other than .cue can be easily added for other types of games.
